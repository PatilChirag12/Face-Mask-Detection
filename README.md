# Face-Mask-Detection
Face mask detection in deep learning is a computer vision application that uses neural networks to automatically identify whether individuals in images or video streams are wearing face masks. This technology typically employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on datasets containing thousands of images of people with and without masks in various lighting conditions, angles, and environments.
The detection system works by first locating faces in the input image using face detection algorithms, then classifying each detected face as either "mask" or "no mask" using a trained deep learning model. Common architectures include MobileNet, ResNet, or YOLO-based models that can process images in real-time.
Key applications include automated monitoring in public spaces, healthcare facilities, transportation hubs, and workplaces to ensure compliance with mask-wearing policies. The models can be integrated into existing security camera systems or deployed on mobile devices for instant detection. Training typically involves data augmentation techniques to improve robustness across different demographics, mask types, and environmental conditions, achieving accuracy rates often exceeding 95% in controlled settings.
