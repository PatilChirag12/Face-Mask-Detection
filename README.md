# Face-Mask-Detection
Face mask detection in deep learning is a computer vision application that uses neural networks to automatically identify whether individuals in images or video streams are wearing face masks. This technology typically employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on datasets containing thousands of images of people with and without masks in various lighting conditions, angles, and environments.

The detection system works by first locating faces in the input image using face detection algorithms, then classifying each detected face as either "mask" or "no mask" using a trained deep learning model.
